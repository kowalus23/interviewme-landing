Project made as an exercise of making landing-page direct from PDF.

For better UX, its good to add:
- smooth scroll
- redirect URLS
- if scroll to section, then menu FIXED? or at least an arrow to take you back to the TOP :)

For better code is nice to think about:
- definitely replace anchor #, with refs or sth, generally set more React like scroll
- replace star with dashes by SVG, with CSS its xxxx times faster, but not that responsive ;)
- a little better scss structure, but it's ultra small project
- separate 'JSON' for smaller parts to use in every component for their needs
- do something with FORM values that handle on submit, some DB, Firebase, netlify forms etc.
